The steps I’ve taken to do this are as follows: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Setup Gatsby for blogging <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-07-19-creating-a-blog-with-gatsby/">See here</a></li>\n<li>Move posts from Octopress <code>/_posts</code> into the gatsby project in their own folders. Something like <code>/src/pages/2017-08-...</code></li>\n<li>Rename each post from whatever.markdown to index.md</li>\n<li>Update the timestamps in the posts’ frontmatter from <code>date: 2013-04-06 14:11</code> to something like <code>date: "2013-04-06T14:11:03.284Z"</code></li>\n<li>Move each post image from a global, shared image directory to the same directory as the post that references the image. Update the image path in the post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was then able to run <code>gatsby develop</code> and see my posts. Unfortunately, I had a little trouble with my images — they were being referenced by gatsby and appeared to be output to the browser but were not showing up. Thankfully, some folks in the Gatsby channel in <a href="https://www.reactiflux.com/">Reactiflux</a> suggested adding the following CSS:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-css"><code><span class="token selector">.gatsby-resp-image-wrapper[style]</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> \n  <span class="token property">z-index</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 0 <span class="token important">!important</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>With this addition, my site was up-and-running as expected!</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Migrating to Gatsby from Octopress",date:"August 13, 2017"}}},pathContext:{path:"/blog/2017/08/13/migrating-to-gatsby-from-octopress/"}}}});
