    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development" target="_blank">Behavior Driven Development</a> is something that has interested me forquite awhile. I have constantly tried to write my tests as clear andconcise as possible but once I saw <a href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank">Cucumber for Ruby</a> that became thenew standard for what I was trying to achieve in .NET. This is where<a href="http://specflow.org/" target="_blank">SpecFlow </a>comes in.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>SpecFlow is a BDD library for .NET that aimsto add testing capabilities that are similar to  <a href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank">Cucumber</a> -- that is,specifications are written in human readable Gherkin Format. From the<a href="http://specflow.org/" target="_blank">project site</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>   <a href="http://specflow.org/" target="_blank">SpecFlow </a>aims at bridging the communication gap between domain experts   and developers by binding business readable behavior specifications to  the underlying implementation. <br /></blockquote><p>In theory, I really like that domain experts could write the specifications but I would be interested in seeing how that works out. </p><p><strong>So what exactly is this Gherkin format?</strong> </p><p>According to the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/gherkin" target="_blank">Gherkin project</a> on github, &#39;Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. It is a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html">Business Readable, Domain Specific Language</a> that lets you describe software&rsquo;s behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented.&#39; In other words, its a common DSL for describing the required functionality for a given system.&nbsp;</p><p>This functionality is typically broken down by feature and each feature has a number of scenarios. A scenario is made up of 3 steps: GIVEN, WHEN and THEN (which seems to somewhat loosely correspond to Arrange, Act, Assert) and in a simplistic world, looks a little like this:</p><blockquote> GIVEN an admin user<br />   WHEN user requests top secret data<br />    THEN return the list of data <br /></blockquote>If you want to learn more about the Gherkin format check out <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/cucumber-introduction/" target="_blank">Engine Yard&#39;s Introduction to BDD with Cucumber by Dave Astels</a>  or <a href="http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/given-when-then" target="_blank">Given-When-Then by Aslak Helles&oslash;y</a><p><strong>Quick Synopsis</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve recently started to move my blog over to a new server and a new root domain name; this could have an adverse affect on inbound links. In order to make sure this move was successful, I wanted to write an app to perform 301 redirects from the old URL to the new one. </p><p>There are a number of <a href="http://www.singingeels.com/Blogs/Nullable/2007/09/14/URL_ReWriting_The_Right_Way_Its_Easy.aspx" target="_blank">examples out there already for performing 301s</a> but I wanted to make sure I was testing the code -- It seemed like a great opportunity to get a little more use out of SpecFlow. </p><p><strong>Initial Setup</strong></p><ol> <li><a href="http://specflow.org/getdoc/b647f699-ff30-48db-9bd5-db6dc45016e8/SpecFlowSetup_v1-1-0.aspx" target="_blank">Download and run the SpecFlow installer </a></li>   <li>Create a new Project and add a reference to SpecFlow and NUnit Framework</li>   <li>Add references to your mocking framework (this example is using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/" target="_blank">Moq</a>)</li></ol><p><strong>On with the code!</strong> </p><p>After all the references are sorted out add a SpecFlow feature. <br /><br /><img src="http://ryanlanciaux.github.com/files/templates.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />The feature file is where we&#39;re going to define our specifications. I want to make sure that when a request is made to the old root it will get redirect to the new root url. So here is what the feature looks like initially:</p><blockquote style="width: 550px">  Feature: Redirection <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to not upset the google<br />   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a blogger who almost never has the time to blog<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to redirect my old url to my new one <br />   <br />  Scenario: Redirect root request<br />   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given I have entered a request to http://www.frickinsweet.com/ryanlanciaux.com<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the old url is frickinsweet.com/ryanlanciaux.com<br />   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my new url is ryanlanciaux.com<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the request is made<br />   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the response url is http://www.ryanlanciaux.com<br />   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the response has a 301 in the status </blockquote><p>Notice that over in the Solution Explorer window you can expand the feature to reveal a .cs file. <br /><img src="http://ryanlanciaux.github.com/files/solution_explorer.gif" alt="" /><br />The class is an auto-generated file that updates when the .feature file is changed. We can run this through our test runner to watch it fail and get some extra information as to why it failed. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://ryanlanciaux.github.com/files/test_runner.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />The tests are failing because there is no real definition to the scenario steps. We can almost directly copy and paste the output from the test runner dialog to a new class and fill in the code for the methods with standard unit testing code. Like I said before, I treat everything that is a GIVEN statement like an arrange section of a standard test; WHEN and THEN like act and assert respectively. </p><p>We could hardcode these tests to be specifically run against the urls specified in the scenario but this approach feels brittle and does not encourage code reuse. In order to use these these same steps in our future scenarios we can add wildcard mappings rather than specifying a single url in the attribute definition. The wildcard mapping is the familiar .<em> surrounded by parenthesis.<br /><br /></p><div class="code"><div style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; -webkit-background-clip: initial;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>No Controls?</strong>
Since the very early ASP.NET MVC previews, the
most common argument I've heard against using the framework is the lack
of user controls. In my opinion, this is a mixed blessing, however, for
some, this is a show stopper. What can you do to provide a rich user
interface with the MVC framework, while not reinventing the wheel?</p>

<p><strong>jQuery</strong>
Now
you could go ahead and program a full fledged data grid or WYSIWYG
editor, however, unless you have a bit of time to spare this is not the
ideal solution. As most may realize, jQuery fits very nicely to fill in
the gaps left by the absence of user controls. For the most part, the
controls are not going to let you just drag-and-drop, type in a dataset
and profit but a lot of the pain is kept to a minimum.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>
<a id="k9ve" title="Ingrid" href="http://www.reconstrukt.com/ingrid/">Ingrid</a>
<img src="http://ryanlanciaux.github.com/files/ingrid.gif" alt="" />
If
you're looking for a data grid there are a number of options available
pictured above is Ingrid. <strong>Flexigrid </strong>is another good one that people
have <a id="zc7x" title="used with the MVC framework" href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/MVCFlexigrid.aspx">used with the MVC framework</a>, however, <em>their site appears to be down</em> at the moment.

<p><strong>Getting Started
</strong>So,
if you've decided you want to look more into using jQuery plugins -- a
couple of tips that may make the transition a little easier:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Obviously,
familiarize yourself with jQuery. Some of the plugins will work with
almost 0 configuration but it's much better to actually know what's
going on. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/09/16/jquery-examples-and-best-practices/" target="_blank">View more info on getting started with jQuery</a></li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li>The <a href="http://nayyeri.net/blog/using-jsonresult-in-asp-net-mvc-ajax/" target="_blank">JsonResult</a> is your friend -- <a href="http://www.dev102.com/2008/08/19/jquery-and-the-aspnet-mvc-framework/" target="_blank">learn it well</a>.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li>Read up on what people using different languages are doing. I'm
not saying that you should necessarily go out and learn Rails or
CakePHP/CodeIgniter (although, it is beneficial). but at least look at the
techniques that programmers from that realm of things are doing -- see how they are implementing their controls.</li>
</ul>


<p>What tips do you have for creating robust user interfaces with the MVC framework?</p>

</blockquote>


<br />


<p>As
a web developer / someone who has a blog, I understand dealing with
spam is one of the necessary evils of having a comments enabled on my
site. For the most part, my site has remained far enough under the
radar that most spammers do not waste their time. More recently,
however, there has been a gradual influx of comment spam with a title
something along the lines of &quot;[Company Name] SEO Test.&quot; There is worse
spam for sure but it was definitely annoying. <br /></p>

<br />


<p>A quick Google
search pointed me to a Web Development and Search Engine Optimization
company hosting an SEO competition. I checked the rules and sure enough,
there was a rule stating that only Ethical SEO Techniques would be
permitted. Quickly, I emailed the organization one of the comments
(with url, ip, email, etc) exepecting the offending parties would be
removed from the competition, eliminating additional garbage comments.
I was shocked to receive their reply.<br /></p>

<blockquote>
    <em>Unfortunately
    this is not against the rules of the competition &ndash; I would encourage

<p><strong>Gaming the System</strong><br />
In
my opinion, Search Engine Optimization should be about perfecting a
website and the website&#39;s content; not tricking google into thinking
more people find your content useful than actuality. <a href="http://www.youngentrepreneur.com/blog/2008/12/11/seo-advice-josh-can-help/" target="_blank">Optimizing tags
and titles</a> is one thing but gaming the system to garner search ranking is wrong
and is detrimental to the web as a whole. Just because commenting is
legal and allowable does not make it ethical. Unfortunately, this
practice will continue to exist as long as it gets results and
organizations act as enablers to those who would use these tactics for
financial gain (not to mention increased search engine ranking for the
enabling organizations). <br /></p>

<p><strong>Link Spam is Digital Graffiti</strong><br /></p>

<p>Imagine
for a second if companies condoned this practice outside of the Web --
what if McDonalds or Nike paid for their logos to be spray painted on
other&#39;s property? To make matters worse what if after receiving
numerous complaints they held a press conference and said &quot;soap and
water removes the paint&quot; or &quot;just hire some guards and the problem will
go away.&quot;? I think it&#39;s safe to assume that practice would not be
received so kindly (h/t <a href="http://www.codehinting.com" target="_blank">Matt Braun</a> on the graffiti analogy)!
Fortunately a link is not as hard to remove as paint but the concept is
similar. <br /></p>

<br />


<p><strong>Solutions anyone?</strong><br />
Social networks such as
<a href="http://www.digg.com" target="_blank">Digg</a>, <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com" target="_blank">DotNetKicks </a>and <a href="http://www.dzone.com" target="_blank">DZone </a>have always been plagued by those who would
try to circumvent the rules for personal gain. Where honeypots and
captcha systems would traditionally help against
bots, an increasing number of spammers seem to be actual people. The
administrators of these social networks are constantly coming up with
more sophisticated ways to combat spam but what should small blogs and
websites do?<br /></p>

<br />


<p>Currently,
there are a number of methodologies for preventing blog spam that work
with varying degrees of effectiveness but none are ideal. Obviously,
you can moderate comments -- this works okay but is painful if you are
getting a lot of spam or a lot of comments. Also, make sure your
comment links have a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; attribute (h/t <a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz" target="_blank">Simone Chiaretta</a>). Google
does not take nofollow links into account when calculating page rank.
Although this does not reward the spammer, it does not prevent spam. <br /></p>

<br />


<p>What I would like to see is a centralized comment system like Disqus or
IntenseDebate that lets a user login with OpenID, Google Friend
Connect, Microsoft LiveID, Facebook Connect (whichever the user wants).
There would be a standard vote up / down vote for every comment a user
makes where the overall votes across all sites would determine the
users rating. Casting a down vote would remove a minimal amount of
points from the voter to prevent someone from going on a down vote
rampage (exactly how <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">StackOverflow </a>works). Site owners could set
restrictions that would prevent users with a rating less than a
specified number from posting on their site. This may be idealistic and
introduce a new realm of privacy concerns but if done properly, I think it
would help eliminate a great deal of spam.<br /></p>

<br />


<p><strong>Wrapping things up<br />
</strong>Although there are many less-than ethical tactics to increasing a
site&#39;s ranking, site structure and site content are the best methods of
SEO. I would love to hear your thoughts, ideas and any suggestions you
have in eliminating link spam.</p>

<a href="http://www.codethinked.com">Justin Etheredge</a> recently posted <a href="http://www.codethinked.com/post/2008/09/20/What-is-your-strategy-for-becoming-a-better-developer.aspx" target="_blank">a question</a> for the community on <a href="http://www.codethinked.com" target="_blank">his site</a>. I think this is a good thing to think about because my definition of a good developer is one who continually tries to be better at their craft. My suggestions may be very similar to others but I would love to hear feedback.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Read</strong> : the first suggestion I have is a bit obvious. I like to read books and blogs on programming -- especially methodologies and architecture. Its hard to find good books becuase there seems to be an over saturation, many of which are not good. That being said, there are quite a few that I would still recommend : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns/dp/0596007124" target="_blank">Head First Design Patterns</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222029313&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Don&#39;t Make Me Think</a> (not really a programming book but important for anyone that writes applications with end-users) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/" target="_blank">Code Complete</a>. Additionally I&#39;m really looking foward to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047043399X/" target="_blank">Beginning ASP.NET MVC</a> by <a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/" target="_blank">Simone </a>and <a href="http://nayyeri.net/" target="_blank">Keyvan</a>. As for blogs, there are tons I subscribe to but a few I&#39;ll mention are <a href="http://www.codethinked.com" target="_blank">Justin</a>&#39;s, <a href="http://www.noop.nl" target="_blank">Jurgen Appelo</a>&#39;s and <a href="http://www.diditwith.net" target="_blank">Dustin Campbell</a>&#39;s.

<p>
<strong>Share </strong>:&nbsp; I first started my site to help myself and hopefully others with programming topics. As I chose a subject to write about, I realized I did a lot more research than I would if it was just something I wanted to learn. Additionally, there was a lot of experience that I gained from the comments on the articles. Sharing information with a high level of transparency helps you become a better developer because you will get feedback on your work.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Set Goals</strong> : Set goals to learn new languages / techniques. I start off by reading blogs/books/articles then think of achievable pet project to use these new techniques on. The progress on the project can be used as the baseline for determining your progress. This is not saying you would be an expert in the new area but, in my opinion, is one of the best ways to learn.
</p>


<p>
There are tons of additional ways to become a better developer and I would love to hear your suggestions!
