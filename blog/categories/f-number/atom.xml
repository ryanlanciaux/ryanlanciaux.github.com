    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I&#39;m currently in the process of getting to be more comfortable with Ruby on Rails and really just starting to learn F#. In both cases, simply reading a book or tutorials and following along has not been enough to really get my head around it.
</p>


<p>
First off, I&#39;ve decided I have to have a project or something to work against. For RoR, there&#39;s a little site I&#39;m working on (more on that some other time) -- For F#, I&#39;m currently working thru the <a href="https://prof.ti.bfh.ch/hew1/informatik3/prolog/p-99/" target="_blank">99 Problems</a> with <a href="http://www.joellanciaux.com" target="_blank">my brother</a> (<a href="http://ryanlanciaux.github.com/99problems" target="_blank">you can see our solutions here</a>).&nbsp; When simply reading a book or tutorials you don&#39;t generally come accrossed the same kind of road blocks that you would find in a project. I think overcoming the road blocks is what helps me better understand a language. 
</p>


<p>
All that being said, I think it&#39;s truly important to read as many books, tutorials and source code as you can. <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/13482/reading_to_become_a_better_writer.html" target="_blank">Authors read to become better writers</a> ... as developers we should too (<a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/HowIAmBecomingABetterDeveloperPart1OfInfinity.aspx" target="_blank">See Justice Gray&#39;s blog</a> for more on this). I have this bad habit of thinking in C#/Java/C++; this is pretty much as bad as it would be for me to try and speak Japanese using a English to Japanese dictionary. Seeing how other people code helps me stay away from that.&nbsp;

<p>
What are some steps that you take when you start learning a new language?&nbsp;
