  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using git on most of my hobby projects for quite some time. I prefer the command line when possible, however, it is nice to visualize certain operations. <a href="http://sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> and Github&#8217;s <a href="http://windows.github.com">Windows</a> and <a href="http://mac.github.com">Mac</a> apps are very nice but I&#8217;m mostly on Ubuntu when using git. <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitk.html">Gitk</a> is a decent option but sometimes tools such as this and the aforementioned GUI tools can be a bit over-the-top for a command line junkie such as myself. Something between the command line and full blown windowed GUI applications would be great; this seems to be where <a href="http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/">tig</a> comes in.</p>

<p><a href="http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/">Tig</a> has been around for a little while now but it just came across my radar via <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/05/git-tig/">an excellent post on Atlassian&#8217;s blog by Antoine Büsch</a> (as a side note, it&#8217;s kinda cool to see this post on Atlassian&#8217;s blog considering they make SourceTree). Antoine listed some compelling reasons for using tig but I was sold when he related tig to vim versus other development tools :)</p>

<p>To install tig on Ubuntu just open up a command line and run the obvious <code>apt-get install tig</code>. From there, navigate to a directory under source control (with git) and type <code>tig</code> &#8211; you should see the main log view. Pressing &#8216;h&#8217; will bring up help to see a list of available commands. You can stage changes by pressing &#8216;c&#8217;. For a more exhaustive list of commands, check out <a href="http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/manual.html">the official tig manual</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past several years, I have grown quite accustomed to using a standing desk at home (I have an adjustable Ergotron that I absolutely love). I decided it was about time to make the switch at work, however, I didn&#8217;t want to spend a lot of money on a desk. Thankfully, I had come across a <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">blog post by Colin Nederkoorn</a> on a standing desk he and a coworker built for $22. I like the design, however, I wanted more room for monitors. One of the comments on the blog led me to <a href="http://www.jinyoungkim.com/blog/2012/07/standing-desk/">Jinyoung Kim&#8217;s modification of the Ikea desk</a> which used a wider table than Colin&#8217;s design. I ultimately based my desk plans off Jinyoung&#8217;s design, since it allowed for multiple monitors, laptops and other gadgets.</p>

<p>The main components of the desk are as follows (they should cost about $45 total):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104294/">LACK</a> coffee table &#8211; this is the main piece of the desk.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10056987/#/20094347">EKBY JÄRPEN</a> shelf &#8211; for keyboard / mouse</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10136135/#/10136135">EKBY BJÄRNUM</a> brackets</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/files/desk-setup.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As noted on Jinyoung&#8217;s site, the shelf needs to be sawed down a bit to fit the dimensions of the coffee table. I like the brackets I used since it hides the rougher side of the shelf that was cut down. I would also echo his sentiment about using bolts to hold up the shelf as  they are sturdier than screws. Finally, as someone who has used standing desks for a couple years now I would HIGHLY recommend having a gel kitchen mat to stand on; especially if you&#8217;re over hardwood or concrete flooring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> is currently one of my favorite sites; I love that I can see what my friends are reading and find new books to read based on their recommendations. Noticing that many other blog platforms have sidebar widgets (asides), I decided to create one for Octopress. The first thing I did was make sure I was not duplicating effort. Goodreads has some great <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/edit?tab=widgets">sidebar widgets</a>, however, I preferred to generate the aside in the standard <code>rake generate</code> process (as well as keep the same look-and-feel of the other asides).</p>

<p>The Goodreads API is pretty robust but I was a little concerned about the possibility of a user&#8217;s API key getting checked into github. Thankfully, Goodreads also provides an RSS feed for status updates &#8211; which seemed a bit safer to use for publicly available code (and with the RSS feed it&#8217;s not necessary to obtain an API key). I assumed that if someone didn&#8217;t want their status updates public via RSS, they probably wouldn&#8217;t be installing an aside to display their status.</p>

<p>I created an aside and a subsequent <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki">liquid tags</a> plugin that grabbed and formatted the RSS data. I used REXML to process the xml because it wouldn&#8217;t require users to install additional gems. One thing I still need to figure out is how to pass data from the config.yml into the plugin via the aside. I realize I have access to the config properties via site.whatever  variables but I&#8217;m not entirely sure how to pass that info along to the tag plugin. Currently, the aside needs to be modified with the user&#8217;s Goodreads unique id and the max number of results to display. I noticed some others on the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins">3rd party plugins list on the Octopress wiki</a> are doing the same thing, however, I would prefer to use the config file for the config data :P</p>

<p>All-in-all, it was pretty fun creating the plugin. If you use Octopress and would like to install the Goodreads plugin, <a href="https://github.com/ryanlanciaux/octo-goodreads-status">take a look at the github repo</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I have switched from Windows 8 to Ubuntu on my laptop. Since the primary function of my laptop is development I have spent some time tweaking the software installed to fit my workflow.</p>

<p>The main tool I am using for all my development is <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. I like Sublime Text for many reasons &#8211; it&#8217;s lightweight, great community, tons of plugins and most importantly, <strong>vim keybindings</strong>; needless to say, it&#8217;s pretty awesome.</p>

<p>To start with, I installed the package like so: <code>apt-get install sublime-text</code>. From there, I pretty much followed
<a href="http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/sublime-text">Alex MacCaw&#8217;s excellent post on Sublime Text</a>. Mentioned in the post, <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Package Manager</a> is pretty much a must. As someone who has grown pretty dependent on ReSharper when doing .NET development, I find myself typing Ctrl + Shift + T to switch files (rather than the default Ctrl + P &#8211; which, to me, seems a little weird because doing that in different environments brings up print dialog)</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+t"], "command": "show_overlay", "args": {"overlay": "goto", "show_files": true} }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, since I will be writing most of my blog posts with Sublime Text (yea, this post about Sublime Text was written in Sublime Text :P), I installed <a href="https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview">Markdown Preview</a> through package control. If you notice the statement on the GitHub page, Linux users need to install a different version of Python to get the plugin to work. I wasn&#8217;t super comfortable changing Python just for installing the Markdown plugin. Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview/issues/27#issuecomment-11772098">one of the comments on the plugin&#8217;s GitHub</a> page has a pretty decent walkthrough on how to use pythonbrew to give Sublime Text the version of Python that the plugin needs (without necessarily using it throughout the system).</p>

<p>Now, I only wish there was a way to open up a console directly in Sublime Text &#8211; because alt tabbing to terminal is just so difficult.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, it seems that the only time I&#8217;ve spent with my blog has been moving it to other platforms. Hopefully, that will change with the move to Octopress. Since this is mainly a programming / technical blog, I thought it would be great to host the blog with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>.</p>

<p>The Octopress install was pretty simple.. I mostly just followed the steps on the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Octopress Setup page</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Ruby / rbenv</li>
<li>Install git</li>
<li>Clone the Octopress repo</li>
<li>Export posts from Wordpress</li>
<li>Convert the Wordpress xml file to Jekyll with <a href="https://github.com/theaob/wpXml2Jekyll">wpXml2Jekyll</a></li>
<li>rake generate / rake deploy / git commit origin source (from the examples)</li>
</ol>


<p>The part that gave me the most trouble was hiding legacy posts from the main page area. I wanted to keep some of the posts around for posterity but I didn&#8217;t want them to show up with any sort of prominence on the blog. To that end, I created a folder called &#8216;Legacy&#8217; and a folder within this newly created folder called &#8216;_posts&#8217;. From there, I moved the markdown versions of the posts into this folder. So far so good&#8230;</p>

<p>When I fired up the preview for Octopress, the blog was still loading all the legacy posts in the content area. I asked a question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15852698/octopress-custom-folder-for-old-posts">Stack Overflow</a> (that was subsequently shut down for not being programmy enough &#8211; whoops) and tried a couple other things until I stumbled upon <a href="http://arshad.github.io/blog/2012/05/10/recipe-hiding-posts-from-the-octopress-front-page/">this post</a> on Hiding Pages from Octopress. Making the suggested changes produced the results I was looking for. Mission Accomplished &#8211; for now. I may try to change the &#8216;Recent Posts&#8217; widget so it does not show legacy posts, however, that won&#8217;t be an issue when there is more content.</p>

<p>So, as of this post, I&#8217;ve used all Octopress for all of one new article but I really like the workflow; storing the posts in github is definitely an added benefit. Hopefully, I will continue writing beyond this post but I guess we will see.</p>
