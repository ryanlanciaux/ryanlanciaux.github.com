# Hi, I'm Ryan Lanciaux

I'm a software developer focusing on frontend applications. I help smart software teams and organizations build incredible applications with less development effort. With over ten years of experience, I love helping companies of all sizes -- from startups to organizations in the top 10 of the Fortune 500.

## Background
I've been using React in production for over five years and have used React Native since shortly after its release. While my primary focus is on frontend applications, I also have experience with node, Ruby on Rails, and .NET (and others to a lesser extent). 

Building fast and efficient web applications, Design Systems/Component libraries, TypeScript, GraphQL, and complex architectural problems are some things I enjoy. I appreciate helping teams build processes that help them ship better code faster.  

## Articles
I have many articles on this site, but a couple of highlights are available here:

- [Better frontend development with inspiration from the culinary world](http://ryanlanciaux.com/blog/2019/09/20/the-magic-of-a-mise-en-place-mindset-for-frontend-development/)
- [A feature based approach to React development](http://ryanlanciaux.com/blog/2017/08/20/a-feature-based-approach-to-react-development/)
