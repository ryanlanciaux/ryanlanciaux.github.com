# Hi, I'm Ryan Lanciaux

I'm a software developer focusing on front-end applications. I've been using React in production for over 5 years and have used React Native since shortly after its release. While my primary focus is on frontend applications, I also have experience with node, Ruby on Rails, and .NET.

## Component Libraries / Design Systems

Lately, I've been helping organizations build awesome component libraries that help them communicate more effectively, share code in a manageable way, ensure the quality of each part of an application, and ship code much faster. If you're interested in learning more about this, please see my post on [Better Frontend Development With Inspiration From the Culinary World](http://ryanlanciaux.com/blog/2019/09/20/the-magic-of-a-mise-en-place-mindset-for-frontend-development/) or [reach out (contact form)](https://spaceship.studio).

## Training

Helping others ramp up on these technologies is something I'm passionate about. Professionally, I work with teams to help them learn these technologies or apply some strategies and techniques that I've found to be useful. In my freetime, I give conference / meetup talks and try to share with the larger developer community through videos and articles.
