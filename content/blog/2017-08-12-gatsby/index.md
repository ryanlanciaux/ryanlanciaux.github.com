I've been using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for quite some time on the [Griddle](http://griddlegriddle.github.io/Griddle) documentation and really like it. I wanted to start writing more and thought a fresh start to the blogging system I am using was in order.

A couple of the reasons I've chosen to go with Gatsby (in no particular order):

1. **It's built with React** - One of my main areas of focus right now is React development. This is a system that is familiar to me if I want to customize things.
1. **It Uses Markdown** - I can write my posts in markdown, and sync them with GitHub üëç
1. **It builds a static site** - I can run everything locally with `gatsby develop`. From there, once everything looks like it should, I can build and push the public directory to a specific git branch and my site is updated on GitHub pages.
1. **Plugins** - There are a number of plugins that extend the functionality of the application. 

There are a lot of great options for blogging and static site generation but [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is the one I'm using for now!
