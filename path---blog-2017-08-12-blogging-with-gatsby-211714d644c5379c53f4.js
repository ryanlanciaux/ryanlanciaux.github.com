This is a system that is familiar to me if I want to customize things.</li>\n<li><strong>It Uses Markdown</strong> - I can write my posts in markdown, and sync them with GitHub üëç</li>\n<li><strong>It builds a static site</strong> - I can run everything locally with <code>gatsby develop</code>. From there, once everything looks like it should, I can build and push the public directory to a specific git branch and my site is updated on GitHub pages.</li>\n<li><strong>Plugins</strong> - There are a number of plugins that extend the functionality of the application. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are a lot of great options for blogging and static site generation but <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> is the one I‚Äôm using for now! </p>',frontmatter:{title:"Blogging with gatsby",date:"August 12, 2017"}}},pathContext:{path:"/blog/2017/08/12/blogging-with-gatsby/"}}}});
