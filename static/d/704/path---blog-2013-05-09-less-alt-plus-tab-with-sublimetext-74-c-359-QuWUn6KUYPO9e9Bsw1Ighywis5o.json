There is a plug-in called <a href=\"https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL\">SublimeREPL</a> that lets you run ruby, node and a whole slew of other environments from within SublimeText.</p>\n<p><strong>To install SublimeREPL</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire up the Command Palette (ctrl+shift+p) and type “Package Control: Install Package”</li>\n<li>Search for and install SublimeREPL</li>\n<li>Restart SublimeText</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are using rbenv, (I assume something similar applies to rvm as well) you will need to edit your SublimeREPL settings (Preferences -> Package Settings -> SublimeREPL -> Settings - User) so your rbenv ruby is used.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">{\n  &quot;default_extend_env&quot;: { &quot;PATH&quot;: &quot;{HOME}/.rbenv/shims:{PATH}&quot; }\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>Finally, SublimeREPL uses <a href=\"https://github.com/pry/pry\">pry</a> to power the ruby REPL. If you don’t have the pry gem installed, you will need to install it prior to running ruby console.</p>\n<p>Now that everything is setup you can launch a REPL and test code before you  add it to your project, use rake thru shell, etc. One note, I would be careful about running servers — I was messing around with <a href=\"http://www.sailsjs.com\">one of my favorite new frameworks</a> and realized I could not shut down the server (this occurs with servers and other long running operations). That being said, SublimeREPL is definitely a plug-in I would recommend.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Less alt+tab with SublimeText","date":"May 09, 2013","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/2013/05/09/less-alt-plus-tab-with-sublimetext/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013/05/07/tig-great-git-command-line-tool/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tig: Great git command line tool"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013/06/04/learning-angularjs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learning AngularJS"}}}}
