Since the primary function of my laptop is development I have spent some time tweaking the software installed to fit my workflow.</p>\n<p>The main tool I am using for all my development is <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a>. I like Sublime Text for many reasons — it’s lightweight, great community, tons of plugins and most importantly, <strong>vim keybindings</strong>; needless to say, it’s pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>To start with, I installed the package like so: <code class=\"language-text\">apt-get install sublime-text</code>. From there, I pretty much followed\n<a href=\"http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/sublime-text\">Alex MacCaw’s excellent post on Sublime Text</a>. Mentioned in the post, <a href=\"http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control\">Package Manager</a> is pretty much a must. As someone who has grown pretty dependent on ReSharper when doing .NET development, I find myself typing Ctrl + Shift + T to switch files (rather than the default Ctrl + P — which, to me, seems a little weird because doing that in different environments brings up print dialog)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">{ &quot;keys&quot;: [&quot;ctrl+shift+t&quot;], &quot;command&quot;: &quot;show_overlay&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: {&quot;overlay&quot;: &quot;goto&quot;, &quot;show_files&quot;: true} }</code></pre></div>\n<p>Finally, since I will be writing most of my blog posts with Sublime Text (yea, this post about Sublime Text was written in Sublime Text :P), I installed <a href=\"https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview\">Markdown Preview</a> through package control. If you notice the statement on the GitHub page, Linux users need to install a different version of Python to get the plugin to work. I wasn’t super comfortable changing Python just for installing the Markdown plugin. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview/issues/27#issuecomment-11772098\">one of the comments on the plugin’s GitHub</a> page has a pretty decent walkthrough on how to use pythonbrew to give Sublime Text the version of Python that the plugin needs (without necessarily using it throughout the system).</p>\n<p>Now, I only wish there was a way to open up a console directly in Sublime Text — because alt tabbing to terminal is just so difficult.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sublime text on Ubuntu","date":"April 13, 2013","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2013-04-13-sublime-text-on-ubuntu/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-04-06-moving-to-octopress/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Moving to Octopress"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-05-02-goodreads-status-widget-available-on-github/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Goodreads status widget available on github"}}}}
