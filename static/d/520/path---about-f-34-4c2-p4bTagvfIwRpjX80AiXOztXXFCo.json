I’ve been using React in production for over 5 years and have used React Native since shortly after its release. While my primary focus is on frontend applications, I also have experience with node, Ruby on Rails, and .NET also.</p>\n<h2>Component Libraries / Design Systems</h2>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been helping organizations build awesome component libraries that help them communicate more effectively, share code in a manageable way, ensure the quality of each part of an application, and ship code much faster. If you’re interested in learning more about this, please see my post on <a href=\"http://ryanlanciaux.com/blog/2019/09/20/the-magic-of-a-mise-en-place-mindset-for-frontend-development/\">Better Frontend Development With Inspiration From the Culinary World</a> or <a href=\"https://spaceship.studio\">reach out (contact form)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Training</h2>\n<p>Helping others ramp up on these technologies is something I’m passionate about. Professionally, I work with teams to help them learn these technologies or apply some strategies and techniques that I’ve found to be useful. In my freetime, I give conference / meetup talks and try to share with the larger developer community through videos and articles.</p>\n<h2>Reach out</h2>\n<p>If you’d like to talk more about how I may be able to help your organization or team - please <a href=\"https://spaceship.studio\">contact me through this form</a>, find me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanlanciaux\">Twitter</a>, or <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/lanciaux\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About","date":"January 14, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/about/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/01/09/an-introduction-to-styled-components/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"An introduction to Styled Components","page":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/01/14/snowpack-with-react/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Snowpack with React","page":null}}}}
