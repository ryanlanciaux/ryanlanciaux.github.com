The steps I’ve taken to do this are as follows: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Setup Gatsby for blogging <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-07-19-creating-a-blog-with-gatsby/\">See here</a></li>\n<li>Move posts from Octopress <code class=\"language-text\">/_posts</code> into the gatsby project in their own folders. Something like <code class=\"language-text\">/src/pages/2017-08-...</code></li>\n<li>Rename each post from whatever.markdown to index.md</li>\n<li>Update the timestamps in the posts’ frontmatter from <code class=\"language-text\">date: 2013-04-06 14:11</code> to something like <code class=\"language-text\">date: &quot;2013-04-06T14:11:03.284Z&quot;</code></li>\n<li>Move each post image from a global, shared image directory to the same directory as the post that references the image. Update the image path in the post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was then able to run <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby develop</code> and see my posts. Unfortunately, I had a little trouble with my images — they were being referenced by gatsby and appeared to be output to the browser but were not showing up. Thankfully, some folks in the Gatsby channel in <a href=\"https://www.reactiflux.com/\">Reactiflux</a> suggested adding the following CSS:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.gatsby-resp-image-wrapper[style]</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> \n  <span class=\"token property\">z-index</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 0 <span class=\"token important\">!important</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>With this addition, my site was up-and-running as expected!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating to Gatsby from Octopress","date":"August 13, 2017","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/2017/08/13/migrating-to-gatsby-from-octopress/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017/08/12/blogging-with-gatsby/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blogging with gatsby","page":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017/08/17/running-jest-on-linux/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Running Jest on Linux","page":null}}}}
