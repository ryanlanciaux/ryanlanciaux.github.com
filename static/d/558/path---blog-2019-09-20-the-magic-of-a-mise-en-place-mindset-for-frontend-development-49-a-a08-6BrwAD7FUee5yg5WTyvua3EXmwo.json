It’s something that may seem like more work ahead of time but can help ensure productivity, consistency, and quality.</p>\n<h2>What does this have to do with building our frontend applications?</h2>\n<p>Many frontend technologies have the concept of components. Components are building blocks of our frontend applications but can be overlooked as a tool for ensuring productivity, consistency, and quality. Often times we see focus on the screens that a user of our application sees and overlook the building blocks of these screens. If care and attention to detail are not exercised, it’s easy to end up with a series of one-off and duplicate components in a codebase.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">Brad Frost has an excellent book called Atomic Design</a> about building great design systems. In this book, (<a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">and related article</a>) he defines a design system (or component library) as a series of levels. In this methodology, base level components are atoms, atoms compose into molecules, which compose into organisms and so on (I highly recommend Brad’s <a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">post</a> / <a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">book</a> to really see this mindset in action). While I generally do not use the same terminology, I appreciate the concept of base level components and compound components for building reusable front-end applications.</p>\n<p>You may be noticing that some of these concepts may apply to the mise en place mindset we’re discussing. We can build our components before creating a single screen / page in our application.</p>\n<h2>How can we apply a mise en place philosophy to our codebase?</h2>\n<p>If you’re on board with this mindset, you may find it helpful to work on components in isolation, outside of the standard placement in application. At the most simple level, we could create test pages for each component. This can introduce some challenges ensuring that the pages don’t get deployed, that other developers know where to find them and other things of this nature.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are many tools for working with components in isolation. <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> is the one I use most.</p>\n<p>Using Storybook, we can add stories for each of our components. Imagine we are building a component library that has base components like Button, Text, Card, etc. and a series of more complex compositions of these components. Pages or Screens compose these components to build useful functionality for the users of our applications.</p>\n<p>Storybook helps speed up the process of creating component libraries process by allowing us to run our components outside of our standard application. For example, <code class=\"language-text\">yarn storybook</code> could be configured to start Storybook, where <code class=\"language-text\">yarn start</code> could be configured to run the development version of the application.</p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 583px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 89.02229845626071%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Storybook default screen\" title src=\"/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/970f7/storybook.png\" srcset=\"/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/cf440/storybook.png 148w,\n/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/d2d38/storybook.png 295w,\n/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/970f7/storybook.png 583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<div class=\"center\"><small>Very basic storybook window</small></div>\n<br><br>\nThis separation between where we develop components vs. where we build our application can be very helpful when applying a mise en place mindset. We can see Storybook as the workspace we are preparing and the application screens as the dish that is composed of the various ingredients we prepared in advance.\n<br><br>\n<h2>How does this actually help me?</h2>\n<p>In the culinary world, a chef can make many dishes out of a small number of ingredients expertly prepared. Ingredients are composed to make components of a dish and these components are turned into full meals. This allows chefs to <em>quickly</em> build many dishes of similar quality and consistency.</p>\n<p>Lets use the “fast casual” restaurant Chipotle as an example. There are a series of meal components prepared in advance and ready to be composed into a meal. Imagine how long it would take to if every time a customer placed an order, the people preparing the meal needed to cook and prep every part of the meal. That would open up the process to more variation which may result in lower quality.</p>\n<p>This has a parallel in software development as well. If we build components that are tested and meet the quality standards we desire, we can build screens that give us a higher degree of confidence in the result in less time.</p>\n<p>Lets imagine that we need to build two screens for an application. Product Listing and Product Detail we want related products on product detail to look exactly like the product list.</p>\n<h3>Product listing</h3>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 464px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 104.3103448275862%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Product listing\" title src=\"/static/70661fa960fb2270438e295b4b60c71d/74a01/list.png\" srcset=\"/static/70661fa960fb2270438e295b4b60c71d/cf440/list.png 148w,\n/static/70661fa960fb2270438e295b4b60c71d/d2d38/list.png 295w,\n/static/70661fa960fb2270438e295b4b60c71d/74a01/list.png 464w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<h3>Product detail</h3>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 464px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 104.3103448275862%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Product detail view\" title src=\"/static/59efe4b68ec65d5ddea69a01805d1ed8/74a01/detail.png\" srcset=\"/static/59efe4b68ec65d5ddea69a01805d1ed8/cf440/detail.png 148w,\n/static/59efe4b68ec65d5ddea69a01805d1ed8/d2d38/detail.png 295w,\n/static/59efe4b68ec65d5ddea69a01805d1ed8/74a01/detail.png 464w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<p>We could build a list item component that would be (pseudocode/JSX-like) like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">// ListItem output - JSX like but pseudo code\n&lt;Card&gt;\n  &lt;Flex flexDirection=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;ProductImage src={imageSrc} /&gt;\n    &lt;Flex flexDirection=&quot;column&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Heading&gt;{headingText}&lt;/Heading&gt;\n      &lt;Text&gt;{description}&lt;/Text&gt;\n    &lt;/Flex&gt;\n    &lt;Button onClick={onClick}&gt;Click this&lt;/Button&gt;\n  &lt;/Flex&gt;\n&lt;/Card&gt;</code></pre></div>\n<p>Once we have this in place, we can reuse this in both ProductList and ProductDetail.
