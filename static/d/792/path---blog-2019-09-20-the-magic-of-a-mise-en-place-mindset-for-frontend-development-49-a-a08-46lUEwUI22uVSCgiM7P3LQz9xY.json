While many developers have metrics for what quality means, there’s a challenge in ensuring these metrics are met especially as a codebase grows over time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We build our computer systems the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, and on top of ruins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"quoteCite\">- Ellen Ullman</div>\n<h2>Mise en place</h2>\n<p>While software development is a relatively young field, there are more established industries that we can learn from to help us write better code.

It’s something that may seem like more work ahead of time but can help ensure productivity, consistency, and quality.</p>\n<h2>How can we apply this to frontend development?</h2>\n<p>Many frontend technologies have the concept of components. Components are building blocks of our frontend applications but can be overlooked as a tool for ensuring productivity, consistency, and quality. When approached with a “mise en place” mindset, we can leverage components far more efficiently.</p>\n<p>First off, it’s helpful work on components in isolation, outside of the standard placement in application. This strategy can allow us ensure quality on a component-by-component basis and promote reusability. There are many tools for working with components in isolation but the one I use most is <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a>.</p>\n<p>Using default Storybook, we can add stories for each of our components.</p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 583px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 89.02229845626071%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"storybook\" title src=\"/static/c84c51067326a088c1b0b09c10d503d2/970f7/storybook.png\" srcset=\"/static/c84c51067326a088c1b0b09c10d503d2/cf440/storybook.png 148w,\n/static/c84c51067326a088c1b0b09c10d503d2/d2d38/storybook.png 295w,\n/static/c84c51067326a088c1b0b09c10d503d2/970f7/storybook.png 583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  ","frontmatter":{"title":"The magic of a mise en place mindset for frontend development","date":"September 20, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/2019/09/20/the-magic-of-a-mise-en-place-mindset-for-frontend-development/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019/09/16/windows-subsystem-for-linux-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Windows Subsystem for Linux for JavaScript development"}},"next":null}}
