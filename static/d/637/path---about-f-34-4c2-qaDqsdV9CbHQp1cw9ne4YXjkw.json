I help smart software teams and organizations build incredible applications with less development effort. With over ten years of experience, I love helping companies of all sizes — from startups to organizations in the top 10 of the Fortune 500.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>I’ve been using React in production for over five years and have used React Native since shortly after its release. While my primary focus is on frontend applications, I also have experience with node, Ruby on Rails, and .NET (and others to a lesser extent). </p>\n<p>Building fast and efficient web applications, Design Systems/Component libraries, TypeScript, GraphQL, and complex architectural problems are some things I enjoy. I appreciate helping teams build processes that help them ship better code faster.  </p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been helping organizations build awesome component libraries that help them communicate more effectively, share code in a manageable way, ensure the quality of each part of an application, and ship code much faster.
