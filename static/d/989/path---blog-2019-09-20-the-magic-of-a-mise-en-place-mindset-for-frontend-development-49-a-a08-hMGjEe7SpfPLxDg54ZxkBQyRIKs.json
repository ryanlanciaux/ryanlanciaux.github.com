While many developers have metrics for what quality means, there’s a challenge in ensuring these metrics are met especially as a codebase grows over time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We build our computer systems the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, and on top of ruins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"quoteCite\">- Ellen Ullman</div>\n<h2>Mise en place</h2>\n<p>While software development is a relatively young field, there are more established industries that we can learn from to help us write better code.

It’s something that may seem like more work ahead of time but can help ensure productivity, consistency, and quality.</p>\n<h2>What does this have to do with building our frontend applications?</h2>\n<p>Many frontend technologies have the concept of components. Components are building blocks of our frontend applications but can be overlooked as a tool for ensuring productivity, consistency, and quality. Often times we see focus on the screens that a user of our application sees and overlook the building blocks of these screens. If care and attention to detail are not exercised, it’s easy to end up with a series of one-off and duplicate components in a codebase.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">Brad Frost has an excellent book called Atomic Design</a> about building great design systems. In this book, (<a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">and related article</a>) he defines a design system (or component library) as a series of levels. In this methodology, base level components are atoms, atoms compose into molecules, which compose into organisms and so on (I highly recommend Brad’s <a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">post</a> / <a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">book</a> to really see this mindset in action). While I generally do not use the same terminology, I appreciate the concept of base level components and compound components for building reusable front-end applications.</p>\n<p>You may be noticing that some of these concepts may apply to the mise en place mindset we’re discussing. We can build our components before creating a single screen / page in our application.</p>\n<h2>Tools to help promote this mindset in our codebase</h2>\n<p>If you’re on board with this mindset, you may find it helpful to work on components in isolation, outside of the standard placement in application. At the most simple level, we could create test pages for each component. This can introduce some challenges ensuring that the pages don’t get deployed, that other developers know where to find them and other things of this nature.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are many tools for working with components in isolation. <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> is the one I use most.</p>\n<p>Using default Storybook, we can add stories for each of our components. Imagine we are building a component library that has base components like Button, Text, Card, etc. and a series of more complex compositions of these components. Pages or Screens compose these components to build useful functionality for the users of our applications.</p>\n<p>Storybook helps speed up the process of creating component libraries process by allowing us to run our components outside of our standard application. For example, <code class=\"language-text\">yarn storybook</code> could be configured to start Storybook, where <code class=\"language-text\">yarn start</code> could be configured to run the development version of the application.</p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 583px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 89.02229845626071%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAASCAYAAABb0P4QAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABnElEQVQ4y62Uy07DMBBF+7FIsGDHkm/gd2CLaIVgxQKJpwQtbZMmaR6O4/gRx5dxS7ug0IpQS1eOEvnkzoxnemqSIXkLEOcMwSxBGKUoa4msYjCmgdGadgNrLaRSaGwL2zpS+6N6ejTH+P4Vj2/veHh6QZIx8FqDCYFCaERMLlTUZgF2dMg596t6vLFgUoMLhZKUsYqABkpbjHOF54QUSwTMQFsHv7YCU64wzzlq3aCSBkI1C9Ukrizy2iKr6Rv9wB/YtXqzUuMjTJCkxRJEB7388yZg6QLbHM6YwjTOyJ1eg1a7T7L7FuIq5K0Oh9MIBa8hTbsB3AXYAMbcLELOqRh7AUYE9A6jJN0P0Ic8ns0pZPFVkH87XFa5KMV+HIZU5Qm1m3cmvMN/55BCHgUxykr+eG26FYWAvuWEbsEldQV1SNUVWNIgCIMQRZqCRgqpWe/OdQBeDA3OHxJcf1S4iRz6U4sr0mBKTk0H4GG/xemtwdmdwslA4eDS4KhvcTywmFRLUPsXYEPjKy0rutg0aOcpOOfw7/xwbTvk8BPaZ39zdRNMYgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"storybook\" title src=\"/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/970f7/storybook.png\" srcset=\"/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/cf440/storybook.png 148w,\n/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/d2d38/storybook.png 295w,\n/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/970f7/storybook.png 583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<div class=\"center\"><small>Very basic storybook window</small></div>\n<br><br>\nThis separation between where we develop components vs. where we build our application can be very helpful when applying a mise en place mindset.
