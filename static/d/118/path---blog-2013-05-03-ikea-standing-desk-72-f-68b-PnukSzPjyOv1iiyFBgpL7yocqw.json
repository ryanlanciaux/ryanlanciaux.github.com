I decided it was about time to make the switch at work, however, I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a desk. Thankfully, I had come across a <a href=\"http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html\">blog post by Colin Nederkoorn</a> on a standing desk he and a coworker built for $22. I like the design, however, I wanted more room for monitors. One of the comments on the blog led me to <a href=\"http://www.jinyoungkim.com/blog/2012/07/standing-desk/\">Jinyoung Kim’s modification of the Ikea desk</a> which used a wider table than Colin’s design. I ultimately based my desk plans off Jinyoung’s design, since it allowed for multiple monitors, laptops and other gadgets.</p>\n<p>The main components of the desk are as follows (they should cost about $45 total):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104294/\">LACK</a> coffee table — this is the main piece of the desk.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10056987/#/20094347\">EKBY JÄRPEN</a> shelf — for keyboard / mouse</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10136135/#/10136135\">EKBY BJÄRNUM</a> brackets</li>\n</ul>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/be2210fe764f135760b6e926a5d361d0/e2288/desk-setup.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 104.6875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"desk setup\" title src=\"/static/be2210fe764f135760b6e926a5d361d0/c739e/desk-setup.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/be2210fe764f135760b6e926a5d361d0/8ee9c/desk-setup.jpg 148w,\n/static/be2210fe764f135760b6e926a5d361d0/ebbe7/desk-setup.jpg 295w,\n/static/be2210fe764f135760b6e926a5d361d0/c739e/desk-setup.jpg 590w,\n/static/be2210fe764f135760b6e926a5d361d0/e2288/desk-setup.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>As noted on Jinyoung’s site, the shelf needs to be sawed down a bit to fit the dimensions of the coffee table. I like the brackets I used since it hides the rougher side of the shelf that was cut down. I would also echo his sentiment about using bolts to hold up the shelf as  they are sturdier than screws. Finally, as someone who has used standing desks for a couple years now I would HIGHLY recommend having a gel kitchen mat to stand on; especially if you’re over hardwood or concrete flooring.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ikea Standing Desk","date":"May 03, 2013","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/2013/05/03/ikea-standing-desk/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013/05/02/goodreads-status-widget-available-on-github/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Goodreads status widget available on github"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013/05/07/tig-great-git-command-line-tool/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tig: Great git command line tool"}}}}
