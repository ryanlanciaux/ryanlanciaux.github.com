While many developers have metrics for what quality means, there’s a challenge in ensuring these metrics are met especially as a codebase grows over time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We build our computer systems the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, and on top of ruins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"quoteCite\">- Ellen Ullman</div>\n<h2>Mise en place</h2>\n<p>While software development is a relatively young field, there are more established industries that we can learn from to help us write better code.

It’s something that may seem like more work ahead of time but can help ensure productivity, consistency, and quality.</p>\n<h2>What does this have to do with building our frontend applications?</h2>\n<p>Many frontend technologies have the concept of components. Components are building blocks of our frontend applications but can be overlooked as a tool for ensuring productivity, consistency, and quality. If care and attention to detail are not exercised, it’s easy to end up with a series of one-off and duplicate components in a codebase.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">Brad Frost has an excellent book called Atomic Design</a> that I’ve found very useful for embracing this mindset. In this book (<a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">and related article</a>) he defines a design system (or component library) as a series of levels. In this methodology, base level components are atoms, atoms compose into molecules, which compose into organisms and so on (I highly recommend Brad’s post / book to really see this mindset in action). While I generally do not use the same terminology, I appreciate the concept of base level components and compound components for building reusable front-end applications.</p>\n<p>You may be noticing that some of these concepts may apply to the mise en place mindset we’re discussing. We can build our components before creating a single screen / page in our application.</p>\n<h2>How can you apply this to your codebase?</h2>\n<p>If you’re on board with this you may find it helpful to work on components in isolation, outside of the standard placement in application. There are many tools for working with components in isolation but the one I use most is <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a>.</p>\n<p>Using default Storybook, we can add stories for each of our components.</p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 583px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 89.02229845626071%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAASCAYAAABb0P4QAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABnElEQVQ4y62Uy07DMBBF+7FIsGDHkm/gd2CLaIVgxQKJpwQtbZMmaR6O4/gRx5dxS7ug0IpQS1eOEvnkzoxnemqSIXkLEOcMwSxBGKUoa4msYjCmgdGadgNrLaRSaGwL2zpS+6N6ejTH+P4Vj2/veHh6QZIx8FqDCYFCaERMLlTUZgF2dMg596t6vLFgUoMLhZKUsYqABkpbjHOF54QUSwTMQFsHv7YCU64wzzlq3aCSBkI1C9Ukrizy2iKr6Rv9wB/YtXqzUuMjTJCkxRJEB7388yZg6QLbHM6YwjTOyJ1eg1a7T7L7FuIq5K0Oh9MIBa8hTbsB3AXYAMbcLELOqRh7AUYE9A6jJN0P0Ic8ns0pZPFVkH87XFa5KMV+HIZU5Qm1m3cmvMN/55BCHgUxykr+eG26FYWAvuWEbsEldQV1SNUVWNIgCIMQRZqCRgqpWe/OdQBeDA3OHxJcf1S4iRz6U4sr0mBKTk0H4GG/xemtwdmdwslA4eDS4KhvcTywmFRLUPsXYEPjKy0rutg0aOcpOOfw7/xwbTvk8BPaZ39zdRNMYgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"storybook\" title src=\"/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/970f7/storybook.png\" srcset=\"/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/cf440/storybook.png 148w,\n/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/d2d38/storybook.png 295w,\n/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/970f7/storybook.png 583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<p>Once our components are in place, we can focus on the logic instead of layout / styling.
