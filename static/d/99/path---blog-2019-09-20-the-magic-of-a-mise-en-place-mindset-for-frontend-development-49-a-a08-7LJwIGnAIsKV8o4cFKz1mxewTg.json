Components are building blocks of our frontend applications but can be overlooked as a tool for ensuring productivity, consistency, and quality. When approached with a “mise en place” mindset, we can leverage components far more efficiently.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">Brad Frost has an excellent book called Atomic Design</a> that I’ve found very useful for embracing this mindset. In this book (<a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">and related article</a>) he defines</p>\n<p>First off, it’s helpful work on components in isolation, outside of the standard placement in application. This strategy can allow us ensure quality on a component-by-component basis and promote reusability. There are many tools for working with components in isolation but the one I use most is <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a>.</p>\n<p>Using default Storybook, we can add stories for each of our components.</p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 583px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 89.02229845626071%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"storybook\" title src=\"/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/970f7/storybook.png\" srcset=\"/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/cf440/storybook.png 148w,\n/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/d2d38/storybook.png 295w,\n/static/e0a4ab12c8729983676996d9881fd6df/970f7/storybook.png 583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<p>This may not be super compelling at this point but Storybook has the ability to extend the default behavior with addons.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The magic of a mise en place mindset for frontend development","date":"September 20, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/2019/09/20/the-magic-of-a-mise-en-place-mindset-for-frontend-development/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019/09/16/windows-subsystem-for-linux-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Windows Subsystem for Linux for JavaScript development"}},"next":null}}
