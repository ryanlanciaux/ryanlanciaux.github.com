This is a really short post but I wanted to pass the word along. I just finished a fun little ASP.NET MVC Application to generate Visual Studio
themes based off of 3 given colors. I have always felt that selecting
every color to make a coherent theme is way too repetitive. This web
application automatically chooses complements / contrasts based off
your initial color selections (and uses jQuery to let you preview your
theme before creating). I will be making another, more detailed post later that will explain how it all works but for now, <a href="http://www.frickinsweet.com/tools">check it out</a> and let me know what you think.
