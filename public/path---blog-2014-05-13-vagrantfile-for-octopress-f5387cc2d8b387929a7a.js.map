First off, the <a href=\\\"https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/index.html\\\">Vagrantfile</a>:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = \\\"2\\\"\\n\\nVagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|\\n  config.vm.box = \\\"precise64\\\"\\n  config.vm.box_url = \\\"http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box\\\"\\n\\n  config.vm.provision :shell, :path => \\\"bootstrap.sh\\\"\\n  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: '10.0.33.36'\\n  config.ssh.forward_agent = true\\n\\n  config.vm.synced_folder \\\"../octopress\\\", \\\"/home/vagrant/octopress\\\", create: false\\n\\n  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|\\n    vb.customize [\\\"setextradata\\\", :id, \\\"VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/v-root\\\", \\\"1\\\"]\\n    vb.customize [\\\"modifyvm\\\", :id, \\\"--memory\\\", \\\"512\\\"]\\n  end\\nend</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Vagrant files are written in Ruby, however, you don’t need to know Ruby to use Vagrant — the configuration code is nothing too crazy. Lets walk through some of the more interesting parts of the Vagrantfile…</p>\\n<h4>Box settings</h4>\\n<p>The first thing we are doing in the configuration block is defining the type of machine to use. Precise64 is a 64bit Ubuntu 12.04 machine. I generally use this one but there are <a href=\\\"https://vagrantcloud.com/discover/featured\\\">quite a few to choose from</a> in the <a href=\\\"https://vagrantcloud.com/\\\">Vagrant Cloud</a>. With <code>box_url</code> we are describing where this box can be downloaded if it is not currently available on the host machine. </p>\\n<h4>Provision settings</h4>\\n<p>Next, we are telling Vagrant to run this <code>bootstrap.sh</code> as part of it’s <a href=\\\"https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/index.html\\\">provisioning</a> process. Provisioning is where we will define what the environment should look like so it’s not just a base Ubuntu machine. You can provision a Vagrant box with Chef, Puppet, etc. but for this post I’m just using a shell script (still learning Chef). We will take a look at this shell script in a little bit. </p>\\n<h4>Network / Sync settings</h4>\\n<p>Following the vm configuration, we are setting up the networking and folder options for our box. The <code>vm.network</code> property is stating that when there is a webserver running on this machine, we can access it on our host browser at ‘10.0.33.36’. The <code>synced_folder</code> property is stating that the folder <code>octopress</code> living in a sibling folder to the folder that the Vagrantfile is contained in should be accessible within the virtual machine as <code>~/octopress</code>. The octopress directory already exists (and has it’s own github repo) so we do not want to recreate it. </p>\\n<h4>Additional settings</h4>\\n<p>Finally, in the provider block toward the bottom of this script we are adjusting the memory used and setting a property that allows us to use symbolic links. </p>\\n<h2>Provisioning Script</h2>\\n<p>As we talked about earlier, the provisioning script is what differentiates our box from a base Ubuntu machine. In the case of this example it’s basically just a shell script. </p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash\\nHOME=\\\"/home/vagrant\\\"\\nPROV_FILE=.vagrant_provision.lock\\n\\n#inspired by https://github.com/junwatu/nodejs-vagrant \\nif [ -f $PROV_FILE ];\\nthen\\n    echo \\\"Already Provisioned\\\"\\nelse\\n    touch $PROV_FILE\\n\\n    sudo apt-get install -y git make\\n\\n    git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git $HOME/.rbenv\\n\\n    # Install ruby-build\\n    git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git $HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build\\n\\n    $HOME/.rbenv/bin/rbenv install 1.9.3-p194\\n    $HOME/.rbenv/bin/rbenv global 1.9.3-p194\\n\\n    #Add rbenv to PATH\\n    echo 'export PATH=\\\"$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\\\"' >> $HOME/.profile\\n    echo 'eval \\\"$(rbenv init -)\\\"' >> $HOME/.profile\\n\\n    #own rbenv as the vagrant user\\n    sudo chown -Rf vagrant $HOME/.rbenv\\n\\n    #don't like doing this\\n    sudo su - vagrant -c \\\"rbenv rehash && cd /home/vagrant/octopress/ && gem install bundler\\\"\\n    sudo su - vagrant -c \\\"cd /home/vagrant/octopress/ && bundle install\\\"\\nfi</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>I’m not going to spend as much time on this as it’s not too interesting if you know shell scripting (and there is probably a better way to do a lot of this). </p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Check to see if the provision lock exists.

Vagrant will then run through the Vagrantfile and the script to configure the environment. Once the configuration is complete, you can say <code>vagrant ssh</code>. Once you are ssh’d into the box, you can <code>cd octopress</code>, <code>rake generate</code>, <code>rake preview</code>, etc (see <a href=\\\"http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/\\\">Octopress docs</a> for more information). When finished, <code>vagrant halt</code> will shut down the VM. If you need to destroy the box, you simply can type <code>vagrant destroy</code>. Removing the machine does not remove the code in the synced folders or the Vagrant scripts. Running <code>vagrant up</code> will configure the machine all over again and your code will still be intact where you left off.</p>\\n<h2>Finishing up</h2>\\n<p>I have tossed this <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ryanlanciaux/octopress-vagrant\\\">Octopress Vagrantfile and provision script on github</a>.
