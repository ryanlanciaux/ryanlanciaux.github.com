I decided it was about time to make the switch at work, however, I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a desk. Thankfully, I had come across a <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">blog post by Colin Nederkoorn</a> on a standing desk he and a coworker built for $22. I like the design, however, I wanted more room for monitors. One of the comments on the blog led me to <a href="http://www.jinyoungkim.com/blog/2012/07/standing-desk/">Jinyoung Kim’s modification of the Ikea desk</a> which used a wider table than Colin’s design. I ultimately based my desk plans off Jinyoung’s design, since it allowed for multiple monitors, laptops and other gadgets.</p>\n<p>The main components of the desk are as follows (they should cost about $45 total):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104294/">LACK</a> coffee table — this is the main piece of the desk.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10056987/#/20094347">EKBY JÄRPEN</a> shelf — for keyboard / mouse</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10136135/#/10136135">EKBY BJÄRNUM</a> brackets</li>\n</ul>\n<html><head></head><body></body></html>\n<p>As noted on Jinyoung’s site, the shelf needs to be sawed down a bit to fit the dimensions of the coffee table. I like the brackets I used since it hides the rougher side of the shelf that was cut down. I would also echo his sentiment about using bolts to hold up the shelf as  they are sturdier than screws. Finally, as someone who has used standing desks for a couple years now I would HIGHLY recommend having a gel kitchen mat to stand on; especially if you’re over hardwood or concrete flooring.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Ikea Standing Desk",date:"May 03, 2013"}}},pathContext:{path:"/blog/2013/05/03/ikea-standing-desk/"}}}});
